### Late But Not least Check View Page Source 

Some times view page source also contains some sensitive keys.

Example report:

Visited `https://sub[.]example[.]com`

1. View Page Source.
2. Token is Leaking.
3. Searched for API docs.
4. Exploited.
```
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' -X GET https://api-ssl[.]bitly[.]com/v4/user
```
5. Got Read Write Access..


You can automate JS and This one also with cool extension names "Trufflehog"

Hell Yeah, I got more 3 and 4 digit bounties, swags, etc  by just exploiting these keys :) can't disclose Company names but some proof images...
