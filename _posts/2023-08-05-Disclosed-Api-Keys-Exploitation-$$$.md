# Disclosed API key to list user information and complete Exploitation (Can Make $$$$)

Hi, all This is Kullai (Security Researcher). Today I am going to share one of my interesting findings where API keys leaks user information.

![Curl Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*i8FwwQ7FXdwRH4PLtmDo_Q.jpeg)

## Description and what this vulnerability is all about :

Developers are increasingly relying on cloud-based tools to automate building code and deployment of services, which is leading to far more instances of accidental public exposure of sensitive data.
There are a lot of things that hackers can do with a developer’s cloud credentials: spin up hundreds of servers, take down servers, “redistribute” DNS and load balancers, and much more.
Accidental public exposure of credentials such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and app secrets is a mistake that can be made by both inexperienced and seasoned developers, particularly when it comes to source control.
Right now, there are thousands of exposed API keys on GitHub that can be found in just minutes using GitHub code search; these can be found in seconds by bots.

## Methodology :
1. GitHub Recon.
2. The target should have API documentation with the curl commands.
3. Js Recon.
4. Android Static analysis.

## Steps To Exploit :

In the methodology part, I discussed the API curl command. If you have that then you may have a high chance of finding this vulnerability.
Now we will get started.

### Github 

1. Suppose you have a target that has API documentation.

2. Go to search and type “target.com api documentation curl “

3. You can this type of commands:
```
curl -H “content-type: application/json” -H “X-Api-Key: yourAPIkey” -X GET https://api.target.com/api/v1/user
```
4. You can see the above command is used to get the user information by knowing just the API key.

5. Now we are going to Git-Hub and we have to perform recon there.

6. Search as “target.com” API key

7. Don’t hurry, you may find a lot of keys there, all keys can be valid and can be invalid.

8. Just replace the yourAPIkey with the key you found from GitHub.

9. Copy the whole command and paste it into any Linux system.

You can see the example:

In my case, it leaks user information like his name, ID, email ID, Profile picture, and some important data about that particular person. And In other websites, it may include PII data also.


### JS_RECON:

1. Basically My methodology is like I collect all waybackurls and gau I sort them.
   
2. After sorting I grep all .js endpoints and I just run nuclei exposures.

   The command looks like this:
```
cat sorted_file.txt | nuclei -t path_of_Nuclei_Exposures_Template
```
Or you can manually search some sensitive tokens or keys and exploit them.


### Android Static Analysis

1. Basically some sensitive tokens and API keys are left in the Java source code of Android apps.
   
2. You can make use of Automation tools or you can go with jadx-gui to read the Android source code or MobSF is also a good choice.
   
3. And In that we can search sensitive keys/tokens and exploit them.


### Late But Not least Check View Page Source 

Some times view page source also contains some sensitive keys.

Example report:

Visited `https://sub[.]example[.]com`

1. View Page Source.
2. Token is Leaking.
3. Searched for API docs.
4. Exploited.
```
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' -X GET https://api-ssl[.]bitly[.]com/v4/user
```
5. Got Read Write Access..


You can automate JS and This one also with cool extension names "Trufflehog"

Hell Yeah, I got more 3 and 4 digit bounties, swags, etc  by just exploiting these keys :) can't disclose Company names but some proof images...

$3000 from one Hackerone Private Program (Android)

### Main point never ever report any token or API key without proper exploitation If you are unable to do Ping me I will help:)

Thanks for reading my article :)

Happy Hacking
